# **Gempire: A Premium E-commerce Experience üíé**

Welcome to Gempire, a sophisticated e-commerce platform built with Next.js that offers a seamless shopping experience and a robust administrative dashboard. This project showcases modern web development practices, focusing on performance, user experience, and a scalable architecture. It's designed to be both aesthetically pleasing for customers and highly functional for administrators managing products and orders.

## **Getting Started**

Follow these straightforward steps to get Gempire up and running on your local machine.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, grab the project's source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amnesia2k/gempire-client.git
cd gempire-client
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. Ensure you have it installed globally (`npm install -g pnpm`). Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### **3. Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project based on the `.env.example` file. While the example currently doesn't specify any unique variables, you would typically add API keys, database URLs, or other sensitive information here.

```
# .env.example contains placeholders for future environment variables.
# No sensitive keys are directly needed for a basic client-side setup.
```

### **4. Run the Development Server**

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **Usage**

Gempire features a dual interface: a public-facing storefront for customers and a secure dashboard for administrators.
